There are 3 kinds of multiplication in the ML I know thus far:
- inner product (standard matrix multiplication, the result is a matrix or a schalar)
- outer product (like the inner product, but with vectors, the result is a matrix)
- Kronecker product (it's like the outer product of 2 matrices, the result is a matrix bigger than the previous ones)

Today I was discussing the psychology of ML and studying, particularly my tendency to understnad the math equations and systems through aligning my inner feelings (emotions, proprioception, etc) with how the equation/system works. ChatGPT told me it's how top scientists work with their ideas. The possible names for this are:
- embodied learning
- algorithmic identification
- systemic empathy
- becoming-the-system
The problem is that when I impersonate some system, I begin work with myself, and it can be hurtful for the ego. I need to understand that I apply my tools to something external, and apply this embodied learning more sparingly.\
I completed (rewrote from the QWENs text) the program, and understood everything (not as solid as I understand FFNNs (I don't like this abbreviation)). The most difficult part for me is recreating the derivation of the softmax function (about why exactly dz[label]-=1), the explanation of it is rather long. But I'll return to it later, I'm sure it's not so hard to understand.

14:08:22. Today I read the code for the backpropagation of the fully connected and conv2d layers. Also I try to use the Sublime Text, because it compiles much faster than VSC. And I try to use the Sublime Merge to upload the code to the Github.

Idk why it doesn't want to insert the date and time in the format dd.mm.yyyy, but fuck it. I don't really care, let it be raw.\
So yesterday I spent a lot of time (whole day), trying to make VSC to work with both .py and .cpp code. It turned out that I just put all files into one folder with the same launch.json and tasks.json file, so those files couldn't operate the compilation and debbugging of all files (considering that C++ needs compilation, and Python doesn't, plus debuggers for them are different). So in the end I put them into 2 different folders, deleted the folders .vsc (to let VSC create blank ones) => and everything started to work. Then I asked ChatGPT and QWEN for some tweaks to those files to make everthing look better.
